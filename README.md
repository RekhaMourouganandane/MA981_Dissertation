A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Methods for Predicting Sunshine and Energy Consumption using Weather Data

The science of forecasting the weather is an important one. In addition to reducing the amount of damage done to property, accurate forecasting can also assist save lives and preserve energy resources. Additionally, it is essential for agriculture, since it provides farmers with the ability to monitor the optimal planting times and provides assistance in crop protection. One of the most difficult tasks that workers in the meteorological and energy departments have to deal with is making predictions about the amount of sunshine and energy usage based on the weather data. In order to prevail over this challenge In this investigation, we utilised the machine learning models to conduct a comparison analysis in order to forecast the amount of sunshine and energy required. This was accomplished with the use of a dataset from the meteorological department that was recorded close to Heathrow Airport in London, and the weather data was obtained from the ECA. In order to provide a more accurate forecast of the energy use, these two sets of data were combined. The date attribute served as the basis for this merging operation. Following the completion of the preliminary steps of data cleaning and data preprocessing, the machine learning model was calibrated. In order to make an accurate forecast of the weather, a number of different machine learning models, including XGboost, ADAboost, Lasso, and Random forest, were utilised. A decision tree, a linear regression model, a ridge model, and a random forest model were utilised in the process of predicting the amount of energy consumed. The Random Forest model had the highest prediction score among these models, both for the forecast of the amount of sunshine and the amount of energy consumed.
